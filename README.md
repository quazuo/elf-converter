# elf-converter \[unfinished\]

Simple C++ program that aims to convert relocatable ELF (.o) files compiled for the x86-64 architecture to files adapted for the AArch64 architecture. Since this is yet unfinished, only a subset of assembly instructions and ELF features are handled. As such, only files that contain exclusively supported instructions are supported by this program.
